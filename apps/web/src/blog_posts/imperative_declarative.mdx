## Intro

Declarative and imperative are known paradigms in computer science.
They both have their pros and cons, and there is no one there is better than the other.
There are developers that might prefer one paradigm, move the other.
A common trend is to market new libraries/frameworks with a declarative API.

### Imperative

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm in which the program specifies a sequence of commands for the computer to perform. In imperative programming, the focus is on describing how a program operates.

### Declarative

Declarative programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm in which the program specifies a desired outcome and the system figures out how to achieve it. In declarative programming, the focus is on describing what the program should accomplish, rather than how it should accomplish it. The implementations details are not important.

In simpler terms, imperative programming tells the computer what to do step by step and line by line, while declarative programming tells the computer what the desired outcome is, what we expect and let the computer decide the best way to achieve the final result.

### How can we define these two paradigms in code?

First an imperative approach toggle the theme between dark and light using vanilla JavaScript where we manipulate the _DOM_.

**Imperative approach**

```js
const darkBtn = document.querySelector(".dark-btn")
const lightBtn = document.querySelector(".light-btn")

;(() => {
  const theme = localStorage.getItem("theme")
  document.documentElement.className = theme
  if (theme === "dark") {
    lightBtn.classList.remove("active")
    darkBtn.classList.add("active")
  } else {
    darkBtn.classList.remove("active")
    lightBtn.classList.add("active")
  }
})()

darkBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark")
  const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme")
  document.documentElement.className = currentTheme
  lightBtn.classList.remove("active")
  darkBtn.classList.add("active")
})

lightBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  localStorage.setItem("theme", "light")
  const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme")
  document.documentElement.className = currentTheme
  darkBtn.classList.remove("active")
  lightBtn.classList.add("active")
})
```

**Declarative approach**
Here we are doing the same thing, but using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to toggle theme between dark and light.

```tsx
import {useTheme} from "theme"

const ThemeChanger = () => {
  const {theme, setTheme} = useTheme()

  return (
    <div>
      The current theme is: {theme} // dark or light
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>Light Mode</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Dark Mode</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We are focusing here more on what we want as the result and not on the implementation details compared to how the imperative example looked like.
The declarative example never touches any element at all, it describes how the UI should look and work and lets React handle the rest. We do not manipulate the _DOM_.

This is one of the philosophies of React, to not think how things should be done, but instead, how should the UI look when the new state is calculated.

Letâ€™s go with another example where we have a list of numbers and where we want to get a new list with only even numbers.
An imperative solution could look like this.

```rust
fn only_even_nums(xs: &Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut res = Vec::new();
    for &x in xs.into_iter() {
        if x % 2 == 0 {
            res.push(x);
        }
    }
    res
}
```

And the declarative approach would look like this:

```rust
fn only_even_nums(xs: &Vec<i32>) -> Vec<&i32> {
     xs.into_iter().filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0).collect::<Vec<&i32>>()
}
```

### Conclusion

No paradigm is better over the other, they both have their pros and cons.
While the imperative paradigm focusing more on the step-by-step instructions for how an executed program achieves the desired results.
The declarative paradigm focusing more on what the computer should accomplish for us, the implementation details are not so important.

There are favor of preference, while imperative is easier to getting start with and declarative paradigm is a more natural way to write programs the more experience you get, that is what I have experienced.
