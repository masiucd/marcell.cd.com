## Intro

A closure in Javascript is a function that has access to variables in its parent scope, even when the parent function is done/returned.
This means that the inner function can refer to and change/manipulate the variables from the parent scope even after the parent has been executed.
Closures are used in different scenarios one common scenario is to make private variables and methods using closures and to create function factories.
