# Array.prototype.at()

If you have not noticed we have a new array method in JavaScript that makes our code a tiny bit cleaner, I am talking about `Array. prototype.at()‌` where we can retrieve an item from the list in a more reader-friendly way.

To get the first item in the array we can type it like this:

```ts
const dogs = [
  {id: 1, name: "Snickers", breed: "Pug"},
  {id: 2, name: "Lassy", breed: "Poodle"},
  {id: 3, name: "Frankie", breed: "Husky"},
]

const firstDog = dogs.at(0)
```

```bash
{ id: 1, name: "Snickers", breed: "Pug" }
```

Previously to retrieve the first item in the array we had to type:

```ts
const firstDog = dogs[0]
```

Okey to retrieve the first item in the array is maybe not that impressive, but what we can do is retrieve items starting at the end of the array.

Today without using the `Array.prototype.at()` method to get the last dog in the list we have to type:

```ts
const lastDogInTheArray = dogs[doges.length - 1]
```

Honestly in my opinion it is not the prettiest syntax, let’s see how we can get the same result but using `Array. prototype.at()` instead.

```ts
const lastDog = dogs.at(-1)
```

```
{ id: 3, name: "Frankie", breed: "Husky" }
```

Here we add a negative one*(-1)* to get the last dog in the array, we are going backward!

I don’t know what you think but I think it is a much cleaner syntax than using the length of the array and then using the square brackets `list[list.length-1]` to retrieve the last item.

Do we pass in a negative two*(-2)* we would get the second last item, if we pass in negative three*(-3)* we would get the third last item, and so on.

- `dogs.at(0)` —> first dog
- `dogs.at(1)` —> second dog
- `dogs.at(2)` —> third dog
- `dogs.at(-1)` —> last dog
- `dogs.at(-2)` —> second last dog
- `dogs.at(-3)` —> third last dog

### Summary

`Array. prototype.at()` is a new array method that takes an integer value and returns the item at that index.
We can pass both positive and negative values depending if we want to start from the beginning or at the end of the array.

- Use the `Array. prototype.at()` method to retrieve an element from the array by its index.
- Positive values to get items, starting from the beginning, `At(1)`.
- Negative values to get items, starting from the end `At(-1)`.
