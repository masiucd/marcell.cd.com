Let's take a look at conditional types in Typescript and check how they work.
To make it simple and to understand the basics of conditional types we will go with a simple example.

Here we have a conditional check that resolves to `"yes"`, but how does this work?

```ts
type Result = true extends boolean ? "yes" : "no"
```

We are doing a check in this part `true extends boolean`.
We can visualize this like a function where we take a parameter that accepts a boolean and call the function with `true` as an argument that makes the function pass.

```ts
function someCheck(param: boolean) {
  if (param) {
    return "yes"
  }
  return "no"
}
```

What would happen if the param does not extend the boolean type in our `Result` type? Let's check.

```ts
type Result = {} extends boolean ? "yes" : "no"
```

Now the Result type will fall back to `"no"` since an empty object literal does not extend the primitive type of boolean.

### Conclusion

We can see that these conditional types are simpler than we think.
They work like functions that take in a param and check if it follows the conditions.
They are split into three parts.

- We have a check `true extends boolean`
- We have a true case `? true`
- We have false case `: false`

And that's it.
Hope you enjoy this post and could learn something from it.
