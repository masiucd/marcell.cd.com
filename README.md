Welcome to my personal site!

This site is built using `Next.js`, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. It allows for efficient development and deployment of web pages, and is optimized for performance and **SEO**.

The site is designed to be simple and easy to navigate. It includes pages for my professional background, my personal interests, and a contact page for anyone who wishes to get in touch with me.

To run the site locally, you will need to have Node.js and `npm`,`pnpm` (or `yarn`) installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands:

`npm` install or `yarn`|`pnpm` install to install the required dependencies
`npm` run dev or `yarn`|`pnpm` dev to start a development server
The site will then be available at http://localhost:3000.

To build and deploy the site for production, run the command `npm`,`pnpm` run build or `yarn` build followed by `npm`,`pnpm` start or `yarn` start.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback on the site. Thank you for visiting!
